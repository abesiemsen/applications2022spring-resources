From another perspective, you'll discover a multitude of decisions you must make as a designer in order to accomplish the task. Among other things, you'll need to ask:</p><ul><li>Who are my stakeholders?</li><li>What are they trying to accomplish?</li><li>What do they already know?</li><li>What do they need to know?</li><li>What do they care about?</li><li>What constitutes success?</li></ul><p>This project is not about inventing something new, or making something beautiful. Rather, it is about recognizing and applying what's appropriate, and making something that <em>works well</em> for the people using it. The most successful solutions will likely be largely transparent to the user's conscious mind.</p><p>The final product of the project will be a clickable html prototype that allows you to demonstrate your solution. It will <em>not</em> include the check-out process, nor parts of the site un-related to the process of selecting a bicycle. It will not include any 'real' programming, or dynamic data. For instance, you should not attempt to make a 'search' feature actually search. It <em>will</em> include everything necessary to clearly <em>convey</em> how the interface will work. Therefore, a search button <em>should</em> take us to a view that looks like search results.</p>",

(An example list: a dark grey cable-knit sweater, a riding lawn mower, a two-line high-performance kite, a mid-range gaming laptop.) Make sure at least two items come from 'niche' stores, not big-box retailers. For each store and item, document the following:</p><ul><li>What UI elements did I <em>see</em> and/or <em>interact with</em> while <em>finding</em>, <em>comparing</em>, <em>selecting</em>, and <em>configuring</em> the specific product?</li><li>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</li><li>Did I know what this element would do <em>before</em> I interacted with it? Why?</li><li>What general problem is this element designed to handle?</li><li>Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</li></ul><p>Discuss with your partner as you go. Perhaps take turns being shopper and observer. Together, see if you can put names to things: 'Query field. Checkbox. Drop-down selector. Results list.' Don't limit yourself to just clickable things, also note the contextual affordances that help you understand what's happening: titles, labels, icons, etc. Make particular note of any confusion/mistakes/wrong turns you make. What misdirected you?</p><p>When you are done, summarize your findings:</p><ul><li>What elements or patterns seem universal?</li><li>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</li><li>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</li><li>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?</li><li>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</li></ul><p>Feel free to trade/combine observation notes with your partner, but write your own concluding summaries.
